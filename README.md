When it came to using the magins i struggle alot but i decided to free lance a bit. I had trouble with making the lines with the dollar value after but I notice I have to be very thorough when matching the words in html and css.

 I tried my best to not use the videos eventho i saw them but im happy with the way things turned out 

cant wait to learn how to make it functional.I know it to early but it s a really good thing yall did with letting us figure it out it let me know i can do this and ive been paying attention .
